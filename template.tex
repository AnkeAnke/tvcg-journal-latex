This template is for papers of VGTC-sponsored conferences such as IEEE VIS, IEEE VR, and ISMAR which are published as special issues of TVCG.
The template does not contain the respective dates of the conference/journal issue, these will be entered by IEEE as part of the publication production process.
Therefore, \textbf{please leave the copyright statement at the bottom-left of this first page untouched}.


\section{Using the Style Template}

\begin{itemize}
	\item If you receive compilation errors along the lines of ``\texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined}'' then please add a new line ``\texttt{\textbackslash let\textbackslash ifpdf\textbackslash relax}'' right after the ``\texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[journal]\{vgtc\}}'' call.	
		Note that your error is due to packages you use that define ``\texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf}'' which is obsolete (the result is that \texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf} is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use ifpdf package instead.
	
	\item Note that each author's affiliations have to be provided in the author footer on the bottom-left corner of the first page.
		It is permitted to merge two or more people from the same institution as long as they are shown in the same order as in the overall author sequence on the top of the first page.
		For example, if authors A, B, C, and D are from institutions 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively, then it is ok to use 2 bullets as follows:
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item A and C are with Institution 1. E-mail: \{a\,$|$\,c\}@i1.com\,.
			
			\item B and D are with Institution 2. E-mail: \{b\,$|$\,d\}@i2.org\,.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item The style uses the \verb|hyperref| package which can typeset clickable hyperlinks using \verb|\href{...}{...}|, hyperlinked URLs using \verb|\url{...}|, and turns references into internal links.
		The style also uses \verb|cleveref| for automatically formatting cross references in a consistent format.
		We recommend that you use the \verb|\cref{label}| and \verb|\Cref{label}| calls instead of \verb|Figure~\ref{label}| or similar.
		\verb|\Cref| should be used when starting a sentence to spell out the reference (e.g.\ \verb|Section|) while \verb|\cref| should be used when referencing within a sentence to abbreviate (e.g.\ \verb|Sec.|).
		Here are examples for use within a sentence: \cref{fig:vis_papers}, \cref{tab:vis_papers}, \cref{sec:supplement_inst,sec:bib_inst}, \cref{eq:sum}.
		The following sentences all start with a reference, so use \verb|\Cref|.
		\Cref{fig:vis_papers} is a \verb|figure| environment.
		\Cref{tab:vis_papers} is a \verb|table| environment. 
		\Cref{sec:supplement_inst,sec:bib_inst} are \verb|section| environments.
		\Cref{eq:sum} is an \verb|equation| environment.
	
	\item The style automatically looks for image files with the correct extension (eps for regular \LaTeX; pdf, png, and jpg for pdf\LaTeX), in a set of given subfolders defined above using \texttt{\textbackslash graphicspath}: figures/, pictures/, images/.
		It is thus sufficient to use ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{CypressView\}}'' (instead of ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{pictures/CypressView.jpg\}}'').
		(Note that png is more appropriate for line art and text than jpg, but vector graphics are best in that case.)
	
	\item For the list of references, you can use \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv}| to avoid adding hyperlinks and DOIs like the default \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow}| does.
		By default, the DOI and URL fields in a bib\TeX\ entry and turns the entire reference into a link, giving priority to the DOI.
		The DOI can be entered with or without the \url{https://doi.org/} prefix.
		See the examples in the bib\TeX\ file and the bibliography at the end of this template.\\\\
		%
		\textbf{Note 1:} occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (``\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}'') if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in hyperref).
		In this case make sure you have the latest version of the hyperref package (i.e., update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-narrow\}}'' (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow\}}'' again after some more editing.\\\\
		%
		\textbf{Note 2:} the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' versions of the bibliography style use the font ``PTSansNarrow-TLF'' for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way.
		This font needs to be available on your \LaTeX\ system.
		It is part of the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/paratype}{``paratype'' package}, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed.
		If you do not have this package yet and want to use a ``\texttt{-narrow}'' bibliography style then use your \LaTeX\ system's package installer to add it.
		If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' in the file name.\\[1em]
		%
		DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the \texttt{abbrv-doi} bibliography style but the compiled PDF shows you the effect of the \texttt{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow} style.
\end{itemize}


\section{Supplemental Material Instructions}
\label{sec:supplement_inst}

\subsection{Long-term Open Science goals}

\textbf{Research should be accessible to everyone.}
Financial means and privileged access should not limit anyone's ability to participate in and learn from research.
As such, research articles and their accompanying supplemental materials should be freely accessible to researchers from all backgrounds, discoverable, and uniquely and persistently identifiable in perpetuity.

\textbf{Research should be transparent, reproducible, and trustworthy.}
Authors should be as transparent as possible about their research process.
Increased transparency can help reviewers and readers judge for themselves whether the research conducted was plausible and whether the results are reliable.
In particular, research should be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Transparent}---enough description and supplemental material should be provided so that reviewers and readers can follow all important details of any processes or analyses.
	
	\item \textit{Reproducible}---a reviewer or reader should, to the extent possible, be able to use the process, software, data, and operating conditions provided by the authors to obtain the same result
	
	\item \textit{Trustworthy}---This combination of transparency and reproducibility will help readers to gain trust in the research process and results.
\end{itemize}
	
\textbf{Research should be replicable and transferable.}
We believe that our community should support knowledge transfer between teams and that research results should stand up to scrutiny by future researchers. An independent team should be able to replicate or transfer the research results in other contexts, locations, domains, and in multiple trials. By making research more transparent and reproducible, we make it easier for future researchers to adopt and adapt the research methodologies to new situations as well as larger or otherwise more convincing studies.

\subsection{Where to upload supplementary material}
We recommend using \url{https://osf.io} as the primary repository for supplemental materials and that authors justify using an alternative repository.
In some cases, \url{https://databrary.org} or \url{https://dataverse.org} may be more appropriate.
We caution authors against using solely IEEE Xplore and IEEE Dataport, GitHub \& GitLab, or institutional repositories / homepages / lab pages, but do encourage hosting multiple mirrors of material.

\subsection{What to include in the Supplemental Material section}

In the Supplemental Material section at the end of the paper, authors should try to be as descriptive and complete as possible about (1) what supplemental materials are available, (2) where they are hosted, and (3) justifications for why materials were omitted (if any).
This section does not count against the page limit, instead being included in the 2-page allotment for References, Acknowledgments, and Credits.
An example is provided below.

\section{Bibliography Instructions}
\label{sec:bib_inst}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sort all bibliographic entries alphabetically but the last name of the first author.
	This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
	\item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Max:1995:OMF,Kitware:2003} (not \cite{Kitware:2003}\cite{Max:1995:OMF}).
	Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order.
	This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
	\item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
	\item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
	\item Articles in journal---items to include:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item author names
		\item title
		\item journal name
		\item year
		\item volume
		\item number
		\item month of publication as variable name (i.e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
		\end{itemize}
	\item use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
	\item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item author names
		\item title
		\item abbreviated proceedings name: e.g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
		\item year
		\item publisher
		\item town with country of publisher (the town can be abbreviated for well-known towns such as New York or Berlin)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm''
			\item should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''
			\item will be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''
		\end{itemize}
		\item for all entries
		\begin{itemize}
			\item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url; alternative: a url in the URL field
			\item provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item when citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.\,g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} describe \dots''
\end{itemize}
