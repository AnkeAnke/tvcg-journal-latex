This template is for papers of VGTC-sponsored conferences such as IEEE VIS, IEEE VR, and ISMAR which are published as special issues of TVCG.
The template does not contain the respective dates of the conference/journal issue, these will be entered by IEEE as part of the publication production process.
Therefore, \textbf{please leave the copyright statement at the bottom-left of this first page untouched}.


\section{Author Details}

Authors should specify ORCID IDs (see \url{https://orcid.org/}  to register) for author disambiguation and long-term contact preservation.
Use \verb|\authororcid{Author Name}{0000-0000-0000-0000}| for each author, replacing the ``Author Name'' and using the 16-digit (hyphenated) ORCID ID for the second parameter.
The template shows an example without ORCID IDs for two of the authors.
ORCID IDs should be provided in all cases.

Each author's affiliations have to be provided in the author footer on the bottom-left corner of the first page.
It is permitted to merge two or more people from the same institution as long as they are shown in the same order as in the overall author sequence on the top of the first page.
For example, if authors A, B, C, and D are from institutions 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively, then it is ok to use 2 bullets as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A and C are with Institution 1. E-mail: \{a\,$|$\,c\}@i1.com\,.

  \item B and D are with Institution 2. E-mail: \{b\,$|$\,d\}@i2.org\,.
\end{itemize}


\section{Hyperlinks and Cross References}

The style uses the \verb|hyperref| package which can typeset clickable hyperlinks using \verb|\href{...}{...}|, hyperlinked URLs using \verb|\url{...}|, and turns references into internal links.

The style also uses \verb|cleveref| to automatically and consistently format cross references.
We recommend that you use the \verb|\cref{label}| and \verb|\Cref{label}| calls instead of \verb|Figure~\ref{label}| or similar.
\verb|\Cref| should be used when starting a sentence to spell out the reference (e.g.\ ``Section'') while \verb|\cref| should be used when referencing within a sentence to abbreviate (e.g.\ ``Sec.'').
Here are examples for use within a sentence: \cref{fig:vis_papers}, \cref{tab:vis_papers}, \cref{sec:supplement_inst,sec:references}, \cref{eq:sum}.
The following sentences all start with a reference, so use \verb|\Cref|.
\Cref{fig:vis_papers} is a \verb|figure| environment.
\Cref{tab:vis_papers} is a \verb|table| environment.
\Cref{sec:supplement_inst,sec:references} are \verb|section| environments.
\Cref{eq:sum} is an \verb|equation| environment.


\section{Figures}

\subsection{Loading figures}

The style automatically looks for image files with the correct extension (eps for regular \LaTeX; pdf, png, and jpg for pdf\LaTeX), in a set of given subfolders defined above using \verb|\graphicspath|: figures/, pictures/, images/.
It is thus sufficient to use \verb|\includegraphics{CypressView}| (instead of \verb|\includegraphics{pictures/CypressView.jpg}|).
Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur during the printing process.

\subsection{Vector figures}

Vector graphics like svg, eps, pdf are best for charts and other figures with text or lines.
They will look much nicer and crisper and any text in them will be more selectable, searchable, and accessible.

\subsection{Raster figures}

Of the raster graphics formats, screenshots of user interfaces and text, as well as line art, are better shown with png.
jpg is better for photographs.
Make sure all raster graphics are captured in high enough resolution so they look crisp and scale well.

\subsection{Figures on the first page}

The teaser figure should only have the width of the abstract as the template enforces it.
The use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page.
Other figures should begin on the second page.
Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the first page will be refused.

\subsection{Subfigures}

You can add subfigures using the \texttt{subcaption} package that is automatically loaded.
Inside a \verb|figure| environment, create a \verb|subfigure| environment.
See \cref{fig:ex_subfigs} for an example.
We can reference individual figures, either fully using \verb|\cref| (\cref{fig:ex_subfigs_a,fig:ex_subfigs_b}) or by letter using \verb|\subref|.
E.g., \subref{fig:ex_subfigs_b}, \subref{fig:ex_subfigs_c}.
Note that \verb|\subref| only works for one label at a time.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\section{Equations and Tables}

Equations can be added like so:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sum}
  \sum_{j=1}^{z} j = \frac{z(z+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

Tables, such as \cref{tab:vis_papers} can also be included.

\section{Supplemental Material Instructions}
\label{sec:supplement_inst}

\subsection{Long-term Open Science goals}

\textbf{Research should be accessible to everyone.}
Financial means and privileged access should not limit anyone's ability to participate in and learn from research.
As such, research articles and their accompanying supplemental materials should be freely accessible to researchers from all backgrounds, discoverable, and uniquely and persistently identifiable in perpetuity.

\textbf{Research should be transparent, reproducible, and trustworthy.}
Authors should be as transparent as possible about their research process.
Increased transparency can help reviewers and readers judge for themselves whether the research conducted was plausible and whether the results are reliable.
In particular, research should be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Transparent}---enough description and supplemental material should be provided so that reviewers and readers can follow all important details of any processes or analyses.

  \item \textit{Reproducible}---a reviewer or reader should, to the extent possible, be able to use the process, software, data, and operating conditions provided by the authors to obtain the same result

  \item \textit{Trustworthy}---This combination of transparency and reproducibility will help readers to gain trust in the research process and results.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research should be replicable and transferable.}
We believe that our community should support knowledge transfer between teams and that research results should stand up to scrutiny by future researchers. An independent team should be able to replicate or transfer the research results in other contexts, locations, domains, and in multiple trials. By making research more transparent and reproducible, we make it easier for future researchers to adopt and adapt the research methodologies to new situations as well as larger or otherwise more convincing studies.

\subsection{Where to upload supplementary material}
We recommend using \url{https://osf.io} as the primary repository for supplemental materials and that authors justify using an alternative repository.
In some cases, \url{https://databrary.org} or \url{https://dataverse.org} may be more appropriate.
We caution authors against using solely IEEE Xplore and IEEE Dataport, GitHub \& GitLab, or institutional repositories / homepages / lab pages, but do encourage hosting multiple mirrors of material.

\subsection{What to include in the Supplemental Material section}

In the Supplemental Material section at the end of the paper, authors should try to be as descriptive and complete as possible about (1) what supplemental materials are available, (2) where they are hosted, and (3) justifications for why materials were omitted (if any).
This section does not count against the page limit, instead being included in the \textbf{2-page allotment for References, Figure Credits, and Acknowledgments}.
An example is provided below.


\section{References}
\label{sec:references}

\subsection{Include DOIs}

All references which have a DOI should have it included in the bib\TeX\ for the style to display.
The DOI can be entered with or without the \url{https://doi.org/} prefix.

\subsection{Narrow DOI option}

The \verb|-narrow| versions of the bibliography style use the font \verb|PTSansNarrow-TLF| for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way.
This font needs to be available on your \LaTeX\ system.
It is part of the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/paratype}{\texttt{paratype} package}, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed.
If you do not have this package yet and want to use a \verb|-narrow| bibliography style then use your \LaTeX\ system's package installer to add it.
If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the \verb|-narrow| in the file name.
DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the \texttt{abbrv-doi} bibliography style.

\subsection{Disabling hyperlinks}

To avoid adding hyperlinks to the references (the default) you can use \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi}| instead of \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref}|.
By default, the DOI field in a bib\TeX\ entry is turned into a hyperlink.

See the examples in the bib\TeX\ file and the bibliography at the end of this template.

\subsection{Guidelines for bibTeX}

\begin{itemize}
  \item All bibliographic entries should be sorted alphabetically by the last name of the first author.
        This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
  \item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Max:1995:OMF,Kitware:2003} (not \cite{Kitware:2003}\cite{Max:1995:OMF}).
        Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order.
        This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
  \item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
  \item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
  \item Articles in journal---items to include:
        \begin{itemize}
  	      \item author names
  	      \item title
  	      \item journal name
  	      \item year
  	      \item volume
  	      \item number
  	      \item month of publication as variable name (i.e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
        \end{itemize}
  \item Use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
  \item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
        \begin{itemize}
  	      \item author names
  	      \item title
  	      \item abbreviated proceedings name: e.g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
  	      \item year
  	      \item publisher
  	      \item town with country of publisher (the town can be abbreviated for well-known towns such as New York or Berlin)
        \end{itemize}

  \item Article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:\\\\
        %
        The paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm'' should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''.
        It will then be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''
  \item For all entries:
        \begin{itemize}
  	      \item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url.
  	      \item Provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB
        \end{itemize}
  \item When citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} describe \dots''
\end{itemize}

\appendix

\section{Appendices}

Appendices can be specified using \verb|\appendix|.
Note, however, that appendices do count against the page limit and that reviewers are not required to review appendices in the supplemental material.
Regardless, we suggest creating a complete version of the paper with all appendices that you then upload in your supplemental material and to arXiv, OSF, or another preprint server.


\section{Troubleshooting}

\subsection{ifpdf error}

If you receive compilation errors along the lines of \texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined} then please add a new line \verb|\let\ifpdf\relax| right after the \verb|\documentclass[journal]{vgtc}| call.
Note that your error is due to packages you use that define \verb|\ifpdf| which is obsolete (the result is that \verb|\ifpdf| is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use \verb|ifpdf| package instead.


\subsection{\texttt{pdfendlink} error}

Occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}) if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in \verb|hyperref|).
In this case, make sure you have the latest version of the \verb|hyperref| package (i.e.\ update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi}| (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref}| again after some more editing.
